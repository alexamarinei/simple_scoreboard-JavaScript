# Basketball Scoreboard

This is a web-based basketball scoreboard application that allows you to keep track of the score for two teams, Home and Guest. It also features a game timer, a "New Game" button to reset the game, and a "Pause Game" button to pause and resume the game.

## Features

- **Home and Guest score tracking**: Update the score for each team with +1, +2, or +3 points.
- **Game timer**: The timer starts at 10:00 and counts down. After 4 periods, the game ends.
- **Leader highlighting**: The leading team is highlighted in a different color. If the scores are tied, a message is displayed.
- **New Game**: Reset the game at any time, setting the score back to 0 and restarting the timer.
- **Pause Game**: Pause and resume the game timer and disable the score buttons when the game is paused.
